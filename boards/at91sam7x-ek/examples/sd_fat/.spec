<h1>SD card datalogger</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The purpose of this project is to create a temperature and pressure logger.
<\p>

<p>
The logger measures and stores temperature and pressure readings on a SD card
using the FAT filesystem, so the user can easily download the stored data by
plugging the SD card straight into a PC. Data can then be graphed, printed or
exported to any other application.
<\p>

<p>
The user can also easily setup different parameters (like the logging rate, the
filename that represents the log, etc.) without reporgramming the device,
using the "BeRTOS ini reader" module.
<\p>
