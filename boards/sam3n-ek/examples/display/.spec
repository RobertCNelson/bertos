<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This example application demonstrates the usage of display libraries, keyboard
drivers and menu creation.
<\p>
<p>
This demo uses the SPI DMA driver to push data on the screen. Since RAM
memory it's not enough to store a full frame, each frame is sent in chunks.
<\p>
<p>
Use the main menu to launch various demo programs; scroll down using the left
push button and select using the right push button.
