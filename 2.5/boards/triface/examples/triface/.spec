<h1>Generic I/O board</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Triface is a generic development board designed by Develer. The board mounts an
AVR ATmega128/ATmega1281 processor and provides 8 digital input ports, 4
analogic input ports, 8 output ports connected to relays (able to commutate a
current of 5A) and 2 RS232 UART port.
</p>
<p>
The purpose of this project is to implement an interactive shell on the UART
port to manage all the devices present on the board.
</p>

<p>
The user will be able to attach a terminal on the UART port and issue specific
commands to read and change the state of the various devices.
