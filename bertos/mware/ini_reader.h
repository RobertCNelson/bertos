 * \brief Ini file reader module.
 *
 * The format accepted is:
 * - Sections must begin at beginning of line. [ Long name ] will be found only if " Long name " is specified as section name.
 * - key can contain any spaces at the beginning and before '=' but not in the middle. Eg. "long key name" is not valid.
 * - values will be stripped of spaces at the beginning and will run until end-of-line. Eg. "=    long value" will be treated as "long value".
 * - no nested sections are allowed.
 * - no comments are allowed inside a line with key=value pair.
 * - every line that doesn't contain a '=' or doesn't start with '[' will be ignored.
