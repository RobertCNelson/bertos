/**
 * Configure the security level required by the application.
 *
 * Application developers are suggested to keep the strongest
 * setting (default) unless there are memory or code size issues.
 *
 * Available settings are:
 *
 *   * \a RANDOM_SECURITY_STRONG: The random library will use
 *     an entropy pool, automatically feeded by drivers, to gather
 *     entropy from hardware sources. Data from the pool will
 *     be used to reseed a secure random number generator. Moreover,
 *     the generator will be automatically initialised
 *     with enough entropy to generate safe random numbers even
 *     immediately after hw reset.
 *     The overall structure is the same as used by modern
 *	   desktop PCs for generating secure random numbers.
 *
 *  * \a RANDOM_SECURITY_MEDIUM: This intermediate settings will
 *     avoid usage of an entropy pool, to reduce memory and code
 *     usage. The security of this settings relies only on the
 *     good behaviour of the random number generator (even though
 *     it will be well-seeded at startup).
 *
 *  * \a RANDOM_SECURITY_MINIMUM: This is the lighter setting that
 *     allows minimal memory and code usage, and it suggested only
 *     for extremely constrained systems, that only generates few
 *     random numbers. Even if the generator is still secure on
 *     paper, its seeding will not be safe (though still entropic
 *     to allow different sequences to be generated after each reset).
